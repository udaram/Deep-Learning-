This Facial Expression Recogniser Project is  trained on data of Kaggle Competition. Link of competition is given below:-

https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge

The Project is trained with around 28,000 48X48 grayscale images of facial different expressions(Emotions) 
 '''Emotions::
        angry/
        disgust/
        fear/
        happy/
        neutral/
        sad/
        surprise/'''

Convolutional Neural Network has been implemented, on Keras Deep Learning Framework.
After training, the Model is tested with 7178 images. It was found that the model is predicting is predict 58.81% of Accuracy.
The model has tested for the live images taken by me and came out accurate with with some error. 
Accuracy might reach to above or around 80% we use Google Server Cloud for Running the model. Because our Computer CPU take around 2Hours to train and get this much accuracy.
